Essay on my favourite place

My favorite place is the garden, I like to visit the garden very much with my family. We can practice many sports activities with the participation of my brothers or parents.

We very much enjoy the air and the vast scenic views. I really like the smell of roses in the air. Especially in the spring. This is the perfect time that I love to spend time in the garden.

My brothers and I like to start a game of soccer when we arrive. After that we sit for a while to rest and have some drinks and food. Seeing the vast green spaces around me helps me improve my appetite.

Then my dad joins us for a tug-of-war challenge. We laugh a lot when we beat him and there is great fun and joy when he shares this game with us.

After that, my brothers and I go back to ride some rides in the par and enjoy it. And when it gets dark we usually sit down and play some of the games we bring with us. This place is my favorite place that I  enjoy spending a lot of time in.
